Up-to-date (i.e. fewer bugs)!

Pure C: A single library for both C and C++.  Extra features of C++ are used only in inlined functions.  SGE doesn't compile for C without a lot of work.

Implemented strangely missing features (like SPG_Polygon)

Thick primitives

Arc functions

Polygon transforms

Rounded rectangle functions

Functions work with Uint32 color values.  If you want a Uint8 RGB version you'll have to write it yourself; I won't force twice as many functions on everyone.

Convenience functions (Like SPG_MakeRect)

Other cool functions (SPG_ReplaceColorkey)

Anti-aliasing moved into stack instead of so many extra functions

Naming conventions - Less typing, better auto-completion compatibility

Smaller dll: Uses 4/10 SGE modules
 - no shape classes
 - no collision detection
 - no bitmap text
 - no truetype text
 - no text classes
 - no randomizing or delay
